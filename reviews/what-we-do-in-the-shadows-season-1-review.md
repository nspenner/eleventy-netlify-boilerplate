When I first heard about What We Do in the Shadows, the *television series*, I was somewhat concerned. The original film was a beloved piece of modern vampire comedy – but even its premise was showing hints of wearing thin by the end of its runtime. Would the same premise work on a full television series – with an *entirely new cast*?

Thankfully, the answer is yes. Resoundingly so.
